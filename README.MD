# What is this app about
The ability to access the consumption data generated easily and quickly is the reason why the CleanEmon application was developed.

The application enables users to see the following:

- The last recorded value in real time
- Historical data
- Consumption graphs
- Metadata, which can be viewed and edited

# PWA

A PWA is a progressive web app, which is a web app that can be installed on a device and used like a native app. PWAs are progressive because they can be used on any device with a web browser, even if the device does not have internet connectivity. They are web apps because they are built using web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And they are apps because they can provide a native app-like experience to users, which includes features such as push notifications, offline access, and an icon on the device's home screen.
